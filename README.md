# Stock Performance Dashboard
This is a dashboard that I created using Tesla and Gamestop financial data.

The objective of this dashboard was to analyze Tesla and GameStop stock performances over the past 10-15 years. I looked at the financial data for both companies to identify patterns between the historical share price of the stock and the quarterly revenue of the company. 

To collect and extract data on Tesla and GameStop, I used the yfinance and BeautifulSoup Python libraries. I also used the pandas library to create DataFrames for storing the share price and revenue data of each company.
